Probability theory vs. Statistics
- Probability Theory --> Answers are not arguable
- Statistics --> Use the same principle, but different from probability theory
- counting of elementary event in composite space
[[Combinatorial Analysis]]
1.1 introduction
1.2 basic principle of counting
- \# of ways to performance several procedures in succession
1.3 Permutation
- \# of ways to order n element (distinct)
- \# of ways to order n element (non distinct)
- \# of ways to order (r) elements from (n) distinct elements = Permutation
